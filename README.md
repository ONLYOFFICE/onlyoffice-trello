# ONLYOFFICE Trello Power-Up

This Power-Up enables users to edit office documents in [Trello](https://trello.com/en) using ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud or ONLYOFFICE Docs packaged as Document Server - [Community or Enterprise Edition](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Features

The app allows to:

* View and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
* Co-edit documents in real-time using two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, built-in chat.

## Running ONLYOFFICE Docs

To be able to edit documents in Trello, you will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs. You can opt for ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud or install the self-hosted version of the editors.

**ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud**

ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud doesn't require downloading and installation.

To get ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud, [get started here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-registration.aspx).

**Self-hosted editors**

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Enterprise Edition, follow the instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Configuring ONLYOFFICE Trello Power-Up

You can configure ONLYOFFICE app via Power-Ups section within Trello (Board -> Power-Ups -> ONLYOFFICE -> Settings -> Edit Power-Up settings).
In the Settings window, enter:

* **Document Server Address**: The URL of your ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud or the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

* **JWT Secret**: Enables JWT to protect your documents from unauthorized access (further information can be found [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/)).

* **JWT Header**: If JWT protection is enabled, it is necessary to specify a custom header name. This header should be specified in the ONLYOFFICE Docs signature settings as well (further information can be found [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/)).

Please note: if you are using ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud, all the required data/details, including JWT settings, are sent to you via the registration email, or can be found via the Docs Cloud Admin Panel.
