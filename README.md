# ONLYOFFICE Trello Power-Up

This Power-Up enables users to edit office documents in [Trello](https://trello.com/en) using ONLYOFFICE Docs packaged as Document Server - [Community or Enterprise Edition](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Features

The app allows to:

* View and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
* Co-edit documents in real-time using two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, built-in chat.

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

To be able to edit documents in Trello, you will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server). You can install free Community version or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Enterprise Edition, follow the instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Configuring ONLYOFFICE Trello Power-Up

You can configure ONLYOFFICE app via Power-Ups section within Trello (Board -> Power-Ups -> ONLYOFFICE -> Settings -> Edit Power-Up settings).
In the Settings window, enter:

* **Document Server Address**: The URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

* **JWT Secret**: Enables JWT to protect your documents from unauthorized access (further information can be found [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/)).

* **JWT Header**: If JWT protection is enabled, it is necessary to specify a custom header name. This header should be specified in the ONLYOFFICE Docs signature settings as well (further information can be found [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/)).

## Using ONLYOFFICE Trello Power-Up

Users are able to view, edit, and co-author documents uploaded to Trello board cards. The editor opens by clicking on the ONLYOFFICE button on the right Power-Ups panel.
